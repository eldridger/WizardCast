WizardCast
==========

This is a game made specifically for Google's Chromecast. It is not currently on the play market and might never be.

If you have a chromecast and a developer account, you can add this link to the reciever https://googledrive.com/host/0B3Bimrwcy8tlUHNFeGtzTUQzR2s/receiver.html
then download and build the android application. Or take the receiver folder and host it somewhere yourself and add that to the Chromecast developer console.
The APP_ID variable in Casthandler.java will need to be changed to your APP ID given by the Chromecast Developer console.

If you do not have a chromecast or the SDK, visit the game on the browser here: (https://googledrive.com/host/0B3Bimrwcy8tlUHNFeGtzTUQzR2s/receiver.html)
However, the game is optimized for chromecast and looks pretty stupid on the browser right now.
